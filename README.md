## Getting Started

SyferText can be used to work with strings residing on a local machine (or a local worker as we call it in [PySyft](https://github.com/OpenMined/PySyft)), as well as with strings on remote workers. 

To learn how to use SyferText for local string tokenization, you can refer to [this tutorial](https://github.com/OpenMined/SyferText/blob/master/tutorials/Part%200%20-%20(Getting%20Started)%20Local%20Tokenization.ipynb).

For remote string tokenization, check out [this tutorial](https://bit.ly/37VEJ28).

More tutorials are coming soon. Stay tuned!
